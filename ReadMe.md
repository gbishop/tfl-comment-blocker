A quick hack to hide annoying comments on TFL.

To use this with Chrome:

1. Download the code into a folder on your computer.
2. Go to the Extensions page and turn on the Developer Mode switch in the upper
   right.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder with the code.

When you visit the site comments from any of the user ids listed in the
scripts.js file will disappear.

This could be much more user friendly.
